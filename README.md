# Hi there!
👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Sai 👋
I’m an IT Analyst with a strong foundation in system support, application troubleshooting, and technical analysis, and I’m actively expanding my expertise into QA Automation Testing.

Through hands-on projects, I’ve been building Playwright-based UI automation frameworks, focusing on real-world scenarios such as login workflows, validations, assertions, and end-to-end user flows. I enjoy designing clean, maintainable test scripts that improve test reliability and catch issues early in the development cycle.

I hold a Master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, which helps me approach problems analytically and understand systems from both a software and infrastructure perspective. Alongside my IT background, I’m developing strong skills in test automation, API testing, and CI/CD concepts, with a clear goal of transitioning into more advanced QA and automation-focused roles.

I’m passionate about improving software quality, learning modern testing tools, and continuously growing as a QA Automation professional.
